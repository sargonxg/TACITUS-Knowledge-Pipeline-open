# TACITUS-Knowledge-Pipeline Review

## ARCHITECTURE
- The repository primarily contains a single Jupyter/Colab notebook (`TACITUS_PIPELINE_NoOutput.ipynb`) and a minimal README; no backend/frontend application code is present in this repo snapshot.
- The README points to a Colab notebook as the canonical artifact, suggesting the notebook is the primary delivery mechanism for the pipeline rather than a standalone service.

## TECH STACK
- Jupyter/Colab notebook-based workflow (no explicit runtime dependencies are declared in this repository snapshot).
- External Colab runtime is implied by the README’s notebook link.

## PROJECT & CURRENT TASK
- The README describes the project as the “TACITUS Knowledge Pipeline” and points to the canonical notebook location under `/notebooks`.
- No additional implementation details, API surfaces, or deployment instructions are documented in this repository snapshot beyond the notebook pointer.

## CODING STANDARDS
- No coding standards or linting/testing guidance are documented in the repository snapshot.

## KNOWN ISSUES / TECHNICAL DEBT
- The notebook under `/notebooks/tacitus-knowledge-pipeline-v7.ipynb` is present but appears to be an empty placeholder (1 byte), so the canonical notebook content is not available in this repo snapshot.
